The discriminator is modeled as an RNN which gets all the preceding images to decide whether correct image for the timestep. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://arnabgho.github.io/Contextual-RNN-GAN/images/RNN-GAN%20model.png\" width=\"500px\" height=\"440px\"/>\r\n\r\n* The model generates real looking images to generate images accurate according to the particular timestep\r\n\r\nSome Generations (Contextual-RNN-GAN)\r\n----\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://arnabgho.github.io/Contextual-RNN-GAN/images/RNN-GAN%20model-7.png\" width=\"900px\" height=\"440px\"/>\r\n\r\nImpact of Adversarial Loss \r\n-----\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://arnabgho.github.io/Contextual-RNN-GAN/images/RNN-GAN%20model-3.png\" width=\"400px\" height=\"220px\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\nModeling of Consecutive Timesteps\r\n-----\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://arnabgho.github.io/Contextual-RNN-GAN/images/RNN-GAN%20model-4.png\" width=\"900px\" height=\"440px\"/>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://arnabgho.github.io/Contextual-RNN-GAN/images/RNN-GAN%20model-5.png\" width=\"900px\" height=\"440px\"/>\r\n\r\nInteresting Cases\r\n------\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://arnabgho.github.io/Contextual-RNN-GAN/images/RNN-GAN%20model-9.png\" width=\"900px\" height=\"440px\"/>\r\n\r\n* **First Generation** In the first example generation it is interesting to note that the model correctly predicted elements in off diagonal while faltered in the shape of the elements in leading diagonals.\r\n\r\n* **Second Generation** Second example shows an interesting case whereby the image gen- erated by our model is also plausible (if by symmetry it is considered that first and third the semicircular ring is solid and hence fourth and sixth should be solid) while the actual answer is of course plausible according to the reasoning that the (solid vs hollow) flipped in the first two cases then stayed the same for the next two timesteps. Even more interesting is its analysis of the spatial dynamics of the ball and the semicircular ring which it almost correctly captured.\r\n\r\n* **Third Generation** Another very interesting case is the generation which it gets correct. However, in this case the answer figure is exactly similar to the second figure in the se- quence. Therefore, it is not illustrative of the ability of the model to generate the sequence of the pattern.\r\n\r\nApplication of the model to Moving-MNIST\r\n-----\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://arnabgho.github.io/Contextual-RNN-GAN/images/RNN-GAN%20model-2.png\" width=\"900px\" height=\"440px\"/>\r\n\r\nSome Example Problems From DAT-DAR Dataset\r\n------\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://arnabgho.github.io/Contextual-RNN-GAN/images/RNN-GAN%20model-8.png\" width=\"900px\" height=\"440px\"/>",
